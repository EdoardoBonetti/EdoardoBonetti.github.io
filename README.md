# Edoardo Bonetti

## About me
I am a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. Alessandra Russo](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/alessandra.russo/) and [Prof. Daniel Kroening](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/daniel.kroening/). I am a member of the [Oxford Automated Verification](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/verification/) group.

My research interests are in the area of formal methods, with a focus on the verification of machine learning systems. I am currently working on the development of a framework for the verification of neural networks, which is part of the [VeriML](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/projects/VeriML/) project.
